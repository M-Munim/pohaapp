      <p className="text-dark50 font-normal text-base pl-3">Aldehydes and ketones are low-molecular-weight volatile chemicals. The identification of aldehydes and ketones is based on two types of reactions: double bond addition and oxidation. A hydrogen atom and aliphatic or aromatic radicals are connected to the carbonyl group in aldehydes. Formaldehyde is an exception in that two hydrogen atoms are connected to the carbonyl in formaldehyde. Two aliphatic or aromatic groups are attached to the carbonyl group in ketones.</p>
