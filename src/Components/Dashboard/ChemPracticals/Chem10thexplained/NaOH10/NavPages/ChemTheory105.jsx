      <p className="text-dark50 font-normal text-base pl-1 pb-3"><strong>Titration:</strong> is one type of analytical procedure often used in standardization. In a titration, an exact volume of one substance is reacted with a known amount of another substance. The point at which the reaction is complete in a titration is referred to as the endpoint. A chemical substance known as an indicator is used to indicate (signal) the endpoint. The indicator used in this experiment is phenolphthalein. Phenolphthalein, an organic compound, is colorless in acidic solution and pink in basic solution. Sodium hydroxide is a deliquescent material (it absorbs moisture from the air). It is impossible to exactly weigh it. Sodium hydroxide is sometimes known as caustic soda or lye. It's a frequent ingredient in cleaning products and soaps. Sodium hydroxide is a white, odourless substance at ambient temperature. Sodium hydroxide liquid is colourless and odourless. It is extremely reactive to strong acids and water. Sodium hydroxide is a caustic substance. As it dissolves, NaOH can react with moisture in the air and generate heat. If it is near flammable materials, this heat can be enough to start a fire. In bar soaps and detergents, sodium hydroxide is employed. Sodium Hydroxide is also used to unblock pipes as a drain cleaner. Industry uses around 56% of the sodium hydroxide produced, with the paper industry using 25% of the NaOH produced. Other applications include fuel cell manufacturing, food curing, vegetable skin removal for canning, bleach, drain cleaner, oven cleaner, soaps, detergent, paper making, paper recycling, aluminum ore processing, oxide coating, cotton fabric processing, pickling, pain relievers, anticoagulants to prevent blood clots, cholesterol lowering medications, and water treatment.</p>
