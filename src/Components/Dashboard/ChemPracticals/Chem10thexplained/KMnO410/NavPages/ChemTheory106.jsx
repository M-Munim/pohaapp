        <p className="text-dark50 font-normal text-base pl-2">In chemistry, a saturated compound refers to a molecule that contains only single bonds between its atoms. Saturated hydrocarbons are organic compounds consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms, where all carbon atoms are bonded to the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible. Saturated fats are a type of dietary fat that predominantly come from animal sources and are solid at room temperature.</p>

        <p className="text-dark font-semibold text-xl mb-1  pl-1">Unsaturated</p>
        <p className="text-dark50 font-normal text-base pl-2">In contrast, an unsaturated compound contains at least one double or triple bond between its atoms. Unsaturated hydrocarbons are organic compounds with double or triple bonds between carbon atoms. Unsaturated fats are primarily found in plant-based oils, as well as fatty fish and nuts. They remain liquid at room temperature. Picture an unsaturated compound as a partially filled house, where some bonding positions are vacant due to the presence of double or triple bonds.</p>
