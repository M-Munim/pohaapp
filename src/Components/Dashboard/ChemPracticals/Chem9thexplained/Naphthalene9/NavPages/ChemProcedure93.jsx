        <li> Take a 5-6cm long fine capillary. Seal one end of the capillary tube by placing it horizontally into the extreme edge of a small steady Bunsen flame for a few seconds while rotating the capillary tube. the surface of Liquid paraffin.</li>
        <li> Powder a little amount of the chemical whose melting point is to be tested on a permeable plate with a spatula.</li>
        <li> Insert the powdered compound into the capillary tube by gently rotating the open end of the capillary tube into the powdered compound. Tap the capillary tube gently on the porous plate to allow the compound to settle into the closed end. Three to four times, repeat the introducing and tapping operation.</li>
        <li> Moisten the bulb of thermometer with Conc. Sulphuric acid or liquid paraffin and attach the capillary to the lower end of the thermometer.</li>
        <li> Place the thermometer with the capillary tube in the melting point apparatus containing at least two third of its volume liquid paraffin in such a way that the closed end of the capillary remains below</li>
        <li> Now heat the beaker gently and note down the temperature from time to time and finally note down the temperature at which the compound starts melting and completely melts.</li>
        <li>Repeat the experiment with a new capillary tube and fresh quantity of the substance.</li>
