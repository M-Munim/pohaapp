      <p className="text-dark50 font-normal text-base pl-1 mb-2">An organic compound is a chemical substance that contains carbon. Organic chemistry is the study of the manufacture and synthesis of chemical substances. The melting point of a chemical compound is the temperature at which it transforms from solid to liquid.</p>


      <p className="text-dark50 font-normal text-base pl-1 mb-2">The transformation of a compound from solid to liquid state during heating is known as melting, and the temperature at which a solid melts in its pure form is known as the melting point. Because every pure solid has a distinct melting point, determining the melting point aids in compound identification. The presence of impurities decreases the solid's melting point. As a result, melting point can also be used to determine the purity of a chemical. Naphthalene is a type of aromatic hydrocarbon that can be found in coal tar or crude oil. Naphthalene is used to make polymers, resins, fuels, and colours. It is also employed as a fumigant pesticide, which works by converting a solid into a harmful vapour. This is known as sublimation.</p>
