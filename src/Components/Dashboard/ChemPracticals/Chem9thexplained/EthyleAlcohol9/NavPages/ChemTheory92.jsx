      <p className="text-dark50 font-normal text-base pl-2">The boiling point of a chemical is the temperature at which it transforms from a liquid to a gas. The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapour pressure equals atmospheric pressure. It is a feature that is frequently used to assess the purity of a particular substance.</p>
      <p className="text-dark50 font-normal text-base pl-2">Aside from identifying a substance's physical condition (liquid or gas) at ambient or room temperature, boiling point also functions as an indicator of volatility, with higher boiling points implying reduced volatility.</p>
      <p className="text-dark50 font-normal text-base pl-2">The boiling point of an organic molecule is the temperature at which an attractive force (such as the Vander Waal attractive force) or an intermolecular connection (such as a hydrogen bond) breaks and the molecule moves. Intramolecular covalent bonds, on the other hand, are not disrupted at their boiling point. The boiling point of organic molecules is determined by their molecular weight. The boiling point rises with increasing molecular weight.</p>
