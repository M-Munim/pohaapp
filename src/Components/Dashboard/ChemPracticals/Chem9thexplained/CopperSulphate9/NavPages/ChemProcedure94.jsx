        <li><strong>Solution Preparation:</strong> Take around 25-30 mL of water and add small amounts of powdered crude copper sulphate to it. To dissolve it, give it a good stir. Make multiple additions of the powdered sample until just a small amount remains undissolved after some stirring.</li>

        <li> <strong>Filtration of the Solution and Concentration of the Filtrate to Crystallisation point:</strong> Filter the solution and collect the filtrate in a china contaminants are left on the filter paper as residue. To avoid crust formation on the dish's side, the solution is vigorously swirled as it heats up with a glass rod. If a crust forms, it is removed with a glass rod and dissolves into the solution. Allow the solution in the dish not to boil. Cool a drop of the solution by blowing it off the end of a glass rod. When a crust or tiny crystals emerge on the glass rod, this indicates that the crystallisation point has been reached. Turn off the burner and turn off the heat. Place a crystallising dish over the hot saturated solution.</li>

        <li><strong>Drying and crystal separation.
        </strong> Carefully decant the mother liquor. Remove the crystals using a filter paper that has been soaked in the solution. Transfer the crystals to another filter paper and gently press them between the folds of the filter papers to dry.</li>
