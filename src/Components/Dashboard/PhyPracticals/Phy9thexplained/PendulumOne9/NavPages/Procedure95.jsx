            <li>Find the mass of each bob with the help of laboratory balance.</li>
            <li>Measure the diameter of the hook of the bob with the help of a Vernier caliper and calculate the radius of the bob (i.e. D/2)</li>
            <li>Take an inextensible string and tie its one end with the hook of the bob.</li>
            <li>Place the other end of the string between the split corks.</li>
            <li>Clamp the cork on an iron stand. The bob of a pendulum must be a few cm above the ground.</li>
            <li>Measure the length of the string including the hook. The total length of the pendulum will be l=l+r.</li>
            <li>Draw two mutually perpendicular lines with the help of the chalk on the floor mean position o, point A and point B shows extreme position A and B.</li>
            <li>Then release the bob gently. The oscillation of the bob should be along a straight line.</li>
            <li>Start the stopwatch when the bob just passes point o and at the same time start counting the oscillations from zero. Note the time for 2D complete oscillation.</li>
            <li>Repeat step 8 to obtain another value of time t2 and find the mean t, t=(t1+t2)/2.</li>
            <li>Calculate the mean time period for one oscillation as, T=t/10.</li>
            <li>Calculate the time period for each bob and record them. Results will show that the time period for each bob remains the same.</li>

          <ol className="text-dark50 font-normal text-base pl-5 list-decimal">
            <li>The thread should be very light and strong.</li>
            <li>The point of suspension should be reasonably rigid.</li>
            <li>The pendulum should oscillate in the vertical plane without any spin motion.</li>
            <li>The floor of the laboratory should not have vibration, which may cause a deviation from the regular oscillation of the pendulum.</li>
            <li>The length of the pendulum should be as large as possible in the given situation.â€™</li>
            <li>Determination of time for 20 or more oscillations should be carefully taken and repeated at least three times.</li>
            <li>There must not be a strong wind blowing during the experiment.</li>
