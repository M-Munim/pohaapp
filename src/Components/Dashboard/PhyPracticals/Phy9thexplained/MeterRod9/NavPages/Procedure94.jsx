            <li>Suspend the meter rod at the 50 cm mark so that it is balanced horizontally. The meter rod is said to be in equilibrium. The 50 cm mark is the pivot.</li>
            <li>Suspend a mass, m1, from one side of the ruler a distance, d1, from the pivot. Read the distance d1 in cm, from m1 to the pivot. Record in a suitable table. Record the value of mass m1 in kg in the table too.</li>
            <li>For resistors R1 and R2, note three readings of ammeter and voltmeter.</li>
            <li>Suspend a second mass, m2, from the other side of the pivot. Carefully move this mass backward and forward until the meter rod is once more balanced horizontally. Read the distance d2 in cm from the mass m2 to the pivot. Record d2 in cm, in the table, along with the mass m2 in kg.</li>
            <li>Repeat several times using different masses and distances.</li>
            <li>Calculate the turning forces, F1 and F2, using W = mg.</li>
            <li>Calculate the clockwise and anticlockwise moments.</li>

          <ul className="text-dark50 font-normal text-base pl-5 list-disc pb-3">
            <li>Ensure that the surface on which you place the wedge is stable and on the same level. This will help in achieving accurate measurements and maintaining the equilibrium of the system.</li>
            <li>Check the zero reading of the meter rod and make necessary adjustments if needed, before starting the experiment.</li>
            <li>To improve accuracy and reliability, repeat the measurements multiple times and calculate the average. This will help reduce the random error.</li>
