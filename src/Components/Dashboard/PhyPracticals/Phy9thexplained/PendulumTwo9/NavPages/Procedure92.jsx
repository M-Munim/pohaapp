          <li>Measure the diameter of the hook of the bob with the help of a Vernier calliper and calculate the radius of the bob (i.e. D/2).</li>
          <li>Take an inextensible string and tie one end with the hook of the bob.</li>
          <li>Place the other end of the cork between the split cork.</li>
          <li>Clamp the cork o an iron stand. The bob of the pendulum must be only a few cm above the ground.</li>
          <li>Measure the length of the pendulum which will be l=l+h.</li>
          <li>Draw two mutually perpendicular lines with the help of the chalk on the floor mean position o, point A and point B shows the extreme position A and B.</li>
          <li>Then release the bob gently. The oscillation of the bob should be along a straight line.</li>
          <li>Start the stopwatch when the bob just passes point o and at the same time start counting the oscillations from zero. Not the time for 2D complete oscillation.</li>
          <li>Repeat step 8 to obtain another value of time t2 and find the mean t, t=(t1+t2)/2.</li>
          <li>Calculate the mean time period for one oscillation as, T=t/20.</li>
          <li>Repeat the experiment by changing the length of the pendulum in steps of 10cm each.</li>

        <p className="text-dark font-semibold text-xl mb-1">PRECAUTIONS</p>
        <ol className="text-dark50 font-normal text-base pl-5 list-disc mb-4">
          <li>The bob of the pendulum should not be more than a few centimeters above the ground.</li>
          <li>The vibration of the bob should be linear.</li>
          <li>The amplitude of oscillation should be kept small.</li>
