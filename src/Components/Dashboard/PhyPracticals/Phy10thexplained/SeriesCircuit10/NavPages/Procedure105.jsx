            <li>Connect the circuit in a similar manner as shown in a circuit diagram or apparatus arrangement with one of the unknown resistors.</li>
            <li>Find the values of two given unknown resistors R1 and R2 record the observations in the observation table.</li>
            <li>Using Ohmâ€™s law, find the value of each resistance. Let it be R1 and R2.</li>
            <li>Connect the two given resistors in a series combination across the terminals of the voltmeter as shown in the figure above.</li>
            <li>Before starting the experiment, bring the slider of the rheostat to its middle.</li>
            <li>Turn the power supply ON. Slowly rotate its knob till the voltmeter shows a reading of 6 volts.</li>
            <li>Close the key, a current should flow through the circuit as indicated by the ammeter.</li>
            <li>Adjust the circuit so that the current in the circuit remains within the range of the ammeter.</li>
            <li>Note the reading of the voltmeter and ammeter.</li>
            <li>Determine the resistance R of the wire for each reading using the formula. R=V/I</li>
            <li>Take the readings of the voltmeter and ammeter three times by changing the position of the sliding contact of the rheostat.</li>
            <li>Tabulate the readings and find the ratio of V and I for the series combination. It will give the equivalent resistance of the combination.</li>
