            <li>Make all the connections as shown in the experimental setup I by keeping the key off.</li>
            <li>Insert the key when the circuit is connected appropriately.</li>
            <li>For resistors R1 and R2, note three readings of ammeter and voltmeter.</li>
            <li>Connect the circuit as shown in the experimental setup II.</li>
            <li>Resistors and voltmeter both are connected in parallel.</li>
            <li>Record three readings of ammeter and voltmeter and use a rheostat.</li>
            <li>Close the key, a current should flow through the circuit as indicated by the ammeter.</li>
            <li>Remove the key.</li>

            <li>Remove the dust and other insulating particles from the ends of connecting wires by rubbing it with a sandpaper.</li>
            <li>All the connections should be kept tight and properly connected as per the circuit diagram.</li>
            <li>Take out the plug from the plug key in between the two observations.</li>
            <li>A low resistance rheostat should be used in the circuit to obtain a large variation in current.</li>
            <li>A thick copper connecting wire should be used in the circuit.</li>
            <li>The positive terminals of the ammeter and voltmeter must be connected to the positive terminal of the battery</li>
            <li>When there is no current flow, the ammeter and voltmeter should be at zero.</li>
            <li>To avoid heating and change the resistorâ€™s resistance value, the current should flow while taking the readings.</li>
            <li>The least count of ammeter and voltmeter should be calculated properly.</li>
