            <li>Prepare the setup. Fix the sheet of paper on the cardboard with the help of pins. Draw a straight line on the paper with the help of a pencil and ruler.</li>
            <li>Put the bar magnet on this straight line. And with the help of the compass needle, it should be placed in such a way that the north pole of the bar magnet points towards the north pole of the compass needle and the south pole of the bar magnet towards the south pole of the compass needle. It can be done by moving the cardboard.</li>
            <li>Draw the boundaries of the bar magnet on the sheet of paper.</li>
            <li>Now, with the help of a compass, trace the direction in which the compass needle points on the paper.</li>
            <li> Repeat step#4 at multiple times around the bar magnet, starting from one end and moving towards the other.</li>
            <li>Using a ruler connect the traced points to form the magnetic field lines around the bar magnet. The lines should curve from the north pole to the south pole.</li>

            <li>Keep the magnet away from electronic devices.</li>
            <li>While performing the practical, make sure that there are no other magnetic objects nearby.</li>
            <li>Place the magnet correctly. Incorrect placement may lead to inaccurate results.</li>
            <li>Place the magnet on a flat and stable surface.</li>
