          <li>Begin the practical by explaining the importance of the kidney in the human body, highlighting its role in filtering waste products and maintaining fluid balance. b. Show the kidney model to the students, pointing out the different structures such as the renal cortex, renal medulla, renal pelvis, and renal blood vessels.</li>

          <li>Examine the external features of the kidney model. b. Observe the overall shape of the kidney, noting its bean-like appearance. c. Identify the hilum, a concave region on the medial side of the kidney model. Explain that it is the point of entry and exit for blood vessels, nerves, and the ureter. d. Discuss the protective layer surrounding the kidney called the renal capsule.</li>

          <li>Use dissection tools to carefully cut the kidney model along the longitudinal axis. b. Identify and observe the renal cortex, which is the outer layer of the kidney. Note its granular appearance. c. Beneath the cortex, locate the renal medulla, which consists of triangular structures called renal pyramids. Explain that the medulla contains tubules and blood vessels. d. Locate the renal pelvis, a funnel-shaped structure at the center of the kidney model. Explain that it collects urine produced by the kidney and directs it to the ureter. e. Observe the renal blood vessels, such as the renal artery and renal vein, within the kidney model.</li>

          <li>Using a hand lens or magnifying glass, examine the cut surface of the kidney model to observe the microscopic structures called nephrons. b. Point out the glomerulus, a network of tiny blood vessels, and the renal tubules connected to it. c. Explain that the nephron is the functional unit of the kidney responsible for filtering blood and producing urine.</li>
