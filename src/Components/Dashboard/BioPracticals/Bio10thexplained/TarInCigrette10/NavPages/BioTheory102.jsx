Tar contains numerous toxic chemicals and carcinogens that can have detrimental effects on the respiratory system. By conducting a practical demonstration, we can show the presence of tar in cigarette smoke and visually illustrate the differences in lung health between smokers and non-smokers.</p>

        <li>Healthy lungs exhibit a pinkish color and smooth texture.</li>
        <li>Diseased lungs associated with smoking may show tar deposits, blackened areas, and indications of respiratory diseases such as lung cancer or COPD.</li>
        <li>The comparison between healthy and diseased lungs visually emphasizes the negative impact of smoking on lung health.</li>

      <p className="text-dark font-semibold text-xl mb-2">Observation</p>
      <ol className='text-dark50 list-decimal pl-5 pb-3'>
        <li>The cotton ball or filter paper inside the jar turns brown due to the condensation of tar.</li>
        <li>Note the presence of tar by rubbing white tissue paper on the inner wall of the funnel.</li>
