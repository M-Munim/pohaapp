            <li><strong>Prepare the microscope:</strong> a. Turn on the microscope and adjust the light intensity for proper illumination. b. Place a prepared slide of amoeba undergoing binary fission on the microscope stage and secure it using the stage clips. c. Start with the lowest magnification objective lens (usually 10x) and bring it into focus using the coarse and fine adjustment knobs.</li>

            <li><strong>Observe the amoeba:</strong> a. Begin scanning the slide by moving the stage in a systematic manner to locate an area with amoebas undergoing binary fission. b. Once you find a suitable area, center it in the field of view. c. Increase the magnification by switching to a higher power objective lens (e.g., 40x or 100x) for a clearer observation of the process.</li>

            <li><strong>Observe binary fission:</strong> a. Watch the amoebas carefully under the microscope to witness the process of binary fission. b. Note the elongation of the amoeba's body, the appearance of a constriction in the middle, and the eventual separation into two daughter cells. c. Take your time to observe and appreciate the different stages of binary fission.</li>
