        <p className="font-semibold text-dark text-lg my-1 pl-2" >1. Shape and Size:</p>
        <ol className='pl-10 text-dark50 text-base list-disc'>
          <li>Amoeba is typically observed as a single-celled organism.</li>
          <li>It exhibits an irregular and constantly changing shape, often resembling a blob or a droplet of jelly.</li>
          <li>The size of Amoeba can vary, but it is usually between 200 to 500 micrometers in diameter.</li>
        </ol>

        <p className="font-semibold text-dark text-lg my-1 pl-2" >2. Cell Structure:</p>
        <ol className='pl-10 text-dark50 text-base list-disc'>
          <li>The cell of Amoeba is surrounded by a flexible cell membrane.</li>
          <li>It lacks a fixed shape or a rigid cell wall.</li>
          <li>The cytoplasm appears granular and transparent.</li>
          <li>The cell contains a single, large nucleus.</li>
        </ol>

        <p className="font-semibold text-dark text-lg my-1 pl-2" >3. Pseudopodia:</p>
        <ol className='pl-10 text-dark50 text-base list-disc'>
          <li>Pseudopodia, meaning "false feet," are temporary extensions of the cell membrane.</li>
          <li>Amoeba uses pseudopodia for locomotion and capturing food.</li>
          <li>Pseudopodia can be observed protruding from different parts of the cell, constantly changing in shape and direction.</li>
        </ol>

        <p className="font-semibold text-dark text-lg my-1 pl-2" >4. Locomotion</p>
        <ol className='pl-10 text-dark50 text-base list-disc'>
          <li>Amoeba moves by extending and retracting its pseudopodia.</li>
          <li>It uses the pseudopodia to crawl or glide along surfaces or through water.</li>
          <li>The movement of Amoeba is slow and amoeboid, characterized by flowing and changing shape.</li>
        </ol>

        <p className="font-semibold text-dark text-lg my-1 pl-2" >5. Ingestion of Food:</p>
        <ol className='pl-10 text-dark50 text-base list-disc'>
          <li>Amoeba is a phagocytic organism, meaning it engulfs its food.</li>
          <li>Food particles, such as bacteria or organic matter, can be observed within the cytoplasm of Amoeba.</li>
          <li>The process of ingestion involves the extension of pseudopodia around the food particle, forming a food vacuole.</li>
        </ol>

        <p className="font-semibold text-dark text-lg my-1 pl-2" >6. Contractile Vacuole:</p>
        <ol className='pl-10 text-dark50 text-base list-disc'>
          <li>Some slides may show the presence of a contractile vacuole in Amoeba.</li>
          <li>The contractile vacuole is responsible for regulating the water balance within the cell by expelling excess water.</li>
        </ol>



        <p className="text-dark font-bold text-xl my-3">Volvox:</p>

        <p className="font-semibold text-dark text-lg my-1 pl-2" >1. Colony Structure:</p>

        <ol className='pl-10 text-dark50 text-base list-disc'>
          <li>The cells of Volvox contain numerous green chloroplasts, which are responsible for photosynthesis.</li>
          <li>The chloroplasts can be observed as small green structures within the cytoplasm of the cells.</li>
          <li>They are involved in capturing light energy and converting it into chemical energy.</li>
        </ol>

        <p className="font-semibold text-dark text-lg my-1 pl-2" >4. Daughter Colonies:</p>
        <ol className='pl-10 text-dark50 text-base list-disc'>
          <li>Within the larger Volvox colony, smaller daughter colonies can often be observed.</li>
          <li>These daughter colonies are formed through asexual reproduction within the parent colony.</li>
          <li>Daughter colonies appear as small spheres attached to the larger Volvox colony.</li>

        <p className="font-semibold text-dark text-lg my-1 pl-2" >5. Flagella:</p>
        <ol className='pl-10 text-dark50 text-base list-disc'>
          <li>Individual cells of Volvox possess two flagella, which are whip-like structures used for movement.</li>
          <li>The flagella are located at one end of the cell and can be observed as fine, thread-like structures.</li>
          <li>Flagella allow Volvox to move through water by beating in a coordinated manner.</li>
        </ol>

        <p className="font-semibold text-dark text-lg my-1 pl-2" >6. Cellular Differentiation (in certain species):</p>
        <ol className='pl-10 text-dark50 text-base list-disc'>
          <li>Some species of Volvox exhibit cellular differentiation within the colony.</li>
          <li>Within the colony, specialized cells, such as reproductive cells or non-reproductive cells, can be observed.</li>
          <li>The specialized cells often have distinct features or functions.</li>
        </ol>

          <li>It has a definite anterior end (oral groove) and a posterior end (contractile vacuole).</li>
          <li>The size of Paramecium can vary, but it is typically around 100 to 300 micrometers in length.</li>
        </ol>

        <p className="font-semibold text-dark text-lg my-1 pl-2" >2. Cilia:</p>
        <ol className='pl-10 text-dark50 text-base list-disc'>
          <li>Paramecium is covered with numerous hair-like projections called cilia.</li>
          <li>The cilia are evenly distributed on the surface of the cell and can be observed in constant motion.</li>
        </ol>

        <p className="font-semibold text-dark text-lg my-1 pl-2" >3. Oral Groove and Cytostome:</p>
        <ol className='pl-10 text-dark50 text-base list-disc'>
          <li>The anterior end of Paramecium features an oral groove, which is a depressed area lined with cilia.</li>
          <li>The oral groove leads to a mouth-like opening called the cytostome.</li>
          <li>The cytostome is responsible for ingesting food particles, such as bacteria or organic matter.</li>
        </ol>

        <p className="font-semibold text-dark text-lg my-1 pl-2" >4. Macronucleus and Micronucleus:</p>
        <ol className='pl-10 text-dark50 text-base list-disc'>
          <li>Paramecium possesses two types of nuclei: a large macronucleus and one or more small micronuclei.</li>
          <li>The macronucleus is responsible for the everyday functions of the cell, such as metabolism and growth.</li>
          <li>The micronucleus is involved in genetic reproduction and the exchange of genetic material during conjugation.</li>
